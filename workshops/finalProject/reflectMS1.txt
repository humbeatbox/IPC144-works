In MS1, I am facing a challenge of load the wrong file in the wrong directory.
Because I develop in my personal laptop and it builds a new directory for create a program and save the error message.
So that I can not find out where should I put the "posdata.csv" file in until I figure out how my IDE work.

Another part of challenge is I spend a lot of time trying to understand the structure of whole system design even I am just in milestone one.
I found it is totally not necessary because it is just the beginning of the project and I will be clear in the later in the end.

There is no need to use the bool type of variable to handle the function especially I am not familiar with the bool library.
This might make some stupid mistake and making some error for using an unfamiliar stuff.
