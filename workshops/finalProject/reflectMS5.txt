In the final project, using different kind of condition to control the process flow and make the project clearly.
There are few notice to myself to notice.
Firstly, in comapare condition, "=" means set not equal to. This mistake happen lot of times when I tring to compare two numer even make this mistake on midtern exam.
However, it keep show on my code when I am tring compare two numbers and making me to spend time to debug.

Secondly, if create a global variable, it must be make a note to make sure what is the meaning of the variable.
For instance, the global variable "noOfitems" in my final project.
If I don't make any comment some times it means index of items but some times it means the number of items.
Because we use it many times, making comment for myself is nessusary.
