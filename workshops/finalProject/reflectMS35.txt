In milestone 35, I call the address of bill Items.
Using call addresses can save more memory and space to achieve better performance, especially in vast and complex systems.
There is one more very critical point: "Check the question."
I would say this is very important because I spend so much time trying to find out why my output is different from the correct one.
I even suspected that the correct output had a problem until I finally read the instructor word by word and found the answer.
Fortunately, we have a very clear instruction that can help us to follow.
There is one more thing, which is that sometimes we want the code to do it at least once times.
But if the user inputs the wrong input, we can't break it.
Instead, using the do-while loop, the while loop can let us set a flag to break the loop if there are some things wrong.
